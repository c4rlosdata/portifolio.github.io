# Automation and Data Science Projects - Carlos Augusto Rangel do Nascimento

Welcome to my project repository! Here you will find a collection of projects I've developed, focused on automation, data analysis, and artificial intelligence. Each project includes a brief description, source code, and execution instructions. Feel free to explore, use, and contribute!

## üìÅ Projects

### 1. **Bank Reconciliation with Python**
- **Description**: A Python script with a graphical interface that automates the bank reconciliation process, saving up to 30 hours of manual work per month.
- **Technologies**: Python, Tkinter
- **Objective**: Simplify and expedite the reconciliation of bank transactions.

### 2. **WhatsApp Web Message Automation with Python**
- **Description**: A Python script to automate the sending of messages via WhatsApp Web using web scraping techniques.
- **Technologies**: Python, Selenium
- **Objective**: Automate the sending of messages to specific contacts, increasing communication efficiency.

### 3. **AI Agent Creation**
- **Description**: Development of an AI agent capable of analyzing a questionnaire and identifying processes within a company that can be automated.
- **Technologies**: Python, Prompt Engineer, Generative AI
- **Objective**: Propose automation solutions to optimize business operations.

### 4. **Python Trading Bot**
- **Description**: A bot developed in Python for real-time analysis of football matches. Based on predefined strategies, the bot sends entry signals on Telegram.
- **Technologies**: Python, Football APIs, Telegram API
- **Objective**: Automate the analysis of games and the communication of strategies for traders.

### 5 **House Price Prediction with Linear Regression**

**Description**: This project focuses on predicting house prices in Boston using Linear Regression. The model is trained on the well-known Boston Housing dataset, which includes various features such as the number of rooms, crime rate, and proximity to the Charles River, among others. The goal is to create a predictive model that can estimate the price of a house based on these features.

**Key Features**:
- **Data Analysis**: The project begins with an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution of house prices and the relationships between features.
- **Preprocessing**: The dataset is split into training and testing sets, and features are standardized to improve model performance.
- **Model Training**: A Linear Regression model is trained on the standardized data.
- **Evaluation**: The model's performance is evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R¬≤) metrics.
- **Visualization**: The project includes visualizations that compare actual vs. predicted prices and showcase the importance of each feature in predicting house prices.

**Technologies**:
- **Python**: The primary programming language used in the project.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Used for data manipulation and numerical computations.
- **Scikit-Learn**: Utilized for model training and evaluation.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Employed for data visualization.

**Objective**: The primary objective of this project is to develop a reliable model for predicting house prices and to explore the significance of various features in influencing these prices. This project showcases practical applications of machine learning techniques in real-world scenarios.
